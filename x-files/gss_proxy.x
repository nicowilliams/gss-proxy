 *                         README First!
 *
 * This is an initial attempt at creating an XDR representation of the
 * GSS-API for the implementation of a GSS proxy client/server protocol,
 * both over local IPC (for NFS and various other applications) and
 * remote (for ssh-agent-like functionality).
 *
 * This is a work-in-progress.  However, rpcgen(1) on Ubuntu does
 * compile this file.
 *
 * Because the GSS-API is based on "functions" and XDR is the basis for
 * ONC RPC (which is based on "procedures") we use "_arg_" and "_res_"
 * affixes to name structures, and we use those structures to encode
 * function arguments and results, respectively.
 *
 * We unify functions as much as possible into as few RPCs as possible.
 * For example, we unify GSS_Import/Canonicalize/Display_name().  We
 * also unify GSS_Acquire/Add_cred() and the credentials handle inquiry
 * functions.  This way we reduce the number of round-trips needed to
 * use the GSS proxy protocol effectively.
 *
 * Similarly, GSS_Init/Accept_sec_context() return all the information
 * about a context that the app could want, including an exported
 * security context token (so the app can import it).
 *
 * All general meta-data functions, such as GSS_Indicate_mechs() and
 * GSS_Inquire_attrs_for_mech(), are unified as well.
 *
 * We support stateful and stateless proxy server implementations both.
 * Stateless servers will need to store various internal state on the
 * client side, in the form of serialized credential handle references
 * (e.g., ccache names) and exported security context tokens even for
 * partially established security contexts.  Stateless servers will
 * generally want to MAC state stored on the client side.
 *
 * We use gssx_ as a prefix to avoid colliding with the C bindings.
 *
 * We use the XDR '*' operator to denote "optional" fields in structs.
 * But for optional gss_OID and gss_OID_set arguments, and only those
 * types of arguments,  we use empty OID/OID set to denote "not present"
 * (presently no GSS functions have any special semantics for empty
 * OIDs/OID sets; we can use '*' in the future if any new functions are
 * added with such semantics).
 *
 * Most/all RPC arguments/results have typed holes for extensibility.
 * Most/all "handles" have typed holes for extensibility.  Name
 * attributes, credential options, and security context options are all
 * first-class types rather than extensions for those typed holes.
 *
 * For functions like GSS_Set_name_attribute(), GSS_Set_cred_option(),
 * and GSS_Set_sec_ctx_option(), the way these are intended to be
 * implemented with this GSS proxy protocol is as follows:
 *
 *  - For name attributes the client must call the IMPORT_AND_CANON_NAME
 *    RPC once again for each additional name attribute.  The input_name
 *    argument be the same as returned by the previous call to the same
 *    RPC.
 *
 *    This means that an RPC (round trip) is needed for each name
 *    attribute to be set.  This is a result of the semantics of
 *    GSS_Set_name_attribute() and cannot be avoided.
 *
 *  - For credential handle options the client can call ACQUIRE_CRED
 *    with cred_options.  If called with an existing credential handle
 *    and no new elements are needed then no elements will be added to
 *    the output credential, but the desired cred_options should be set
 *    in the new credential (and will be visible).  This allows a
 *    default credential handle to be acquired with cred_options in just
 *    one round-trip for the first option.  Each additional cred_option
 *    requires an additional round-trip with today's
 *    GSS_Set_cred_option().
 *
 *    Note that supported cred_options are indicated on a per-mechanism
 *    basis by the INDICATE_MECHS RPC.
 *
 *  - For security context options the options must be passed in on the
 *    initial call to INIT/ACCEPT_SEC_CONTEXT (and may be repeated on
 *    the remaining calls for a security context, but only the first
 *    will matter).
 *
 *    Note that supported context_options are indicated on a
 *    per-mechanism basis by the INDICATE_MECHS RPC.
